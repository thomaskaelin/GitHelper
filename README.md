# GitHelper

## Introduction

GitHelper is a small CLI-tool that I wrote in C# as a coding kata. Its main goal is to cover my most often used Git-features. Of course, you can use any Git-Client such as [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) to do so, but in my experience, I am much faster using my little helper.

## Building the app

Running the script `build.ps1` will create an "all in one"-executable at `build\GitHelper.exe`. 

## Running the app

The executable reads its configuration from a file called `settings.json`. When running the executable without such a file, it will create a dummy configuration-file in the execution directory. Please set the values according to your needs and re-run the executable afterwards.
