# GitHelper

## Introduction

GitHelper is a small CLI-tool that I wrote in C# as a coding kata. Its main goal is to cover my most often used Git-features. Of course, you can use any Git-Client such as [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) to do so, but in my experience, I am much faster using my little helper.

## Building the app

Running the script `build.ps1` will create an "all in one"-executable at `build\GitHelper.exe`. 

## Running the app

The executable requires a single parameter `-p`, containing the path to a Git-repository cloned on your hard drive.
```
GitHelper.exe -p C:\Repos\MyRepo
```

| [CliWrap](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/CliWrap)                          | CliWrap is a library for interacting with external command-line interfaces. It provides a convenient model for launching processes, redirecting input and output streams, awaiting completion, handling cancellation, and more.                                                                                                       |
| [CommandLineParser](https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline) | The Command Line Parser Library offers CLR applications a clean and concise API for manipulating command line arguments and related tasks, such as defining switches, options and verb commands. It allows you to display a help screen with a high degree of customization and a simple way to report syntax errors to the end user. |
| [Specter.Console](https://spectreconsole.net/)                        | A .NET library that makes it easier to create beautiful console applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Possible Improvements
* Features
  * Reset local working copy
  * Push commits to remote
* Replace hardcoded constants with parameters
  * Path to the Git-Executable (see `GitCliWrapper`)
  * Name of the remote-repository (see `GitFlows`)
  * Encoding of the console (see `UserInteraction`)
  * Color of the user input (see `UserInteraction`)
* Improve configuration of parameters, either by:
  * Replace `CommandLineParser`-library with [Specter.Console.Cli](https://spectreconsole.net/cli/getting-started)
  * Read parameter(s) from a configuration file
* Extract hardcoded translations to `RESX`-files
* Move actions in `UserInteraction` into separate classes
